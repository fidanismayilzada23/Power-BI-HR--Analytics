# HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **employee attrition patterns** using Power BI.
The main objective is to identify the key factors that influence employee turnover
and to provide actionable insights that support HR decision-making and retention strategies.

The dashboard transforms raw HR data into clear, interactive, and business-oriented visuals.

## Dataset Summary
- Total Employees: 1,480  
- Gender Distribution:
  - Male: 889 (60.07%)
  - Female: 591 (39.93%)
- Average Age: 36.9  
- Average Monthly Income: 6.5K  
- Attrition Count: 238  
- Overall Attrition Rate: ~16%  

## Key Analyses & Visualizations
- Attrition Rate by Department  
- Attrition Rate by Age Group  
- Attrition Count by Job Role  
- Attrition by Salary Range  
- Attrition by Years at Company  
- Demographic Analysis:
  - Gender
  - Marital Status
  - Education Level and Field
  - Distance from Home

## Tools & Techniques
- Power BI Desktop  
- Data Cleaning and Transformation  
- Data Modeling  
- DAX Measures for KPIs  
- Interactive Filters and Slicers  

## Key Insights & Findings
- Although male employees represent a higher proportion of the total workforce, the attrition rate is relatively balanced across genders.  
- Employee turnover risk decreases as tenure increases; the highest attrition is observed during the early years at the company.  
- The 26–35 age group is the most critical segment in terms of both employee count and attrition rate.  
- Research & Development (R&D) and Human Resources departments demonstrate lower and more stable attrition rates compared to other departments.  
- Lower salary bands are associated with higher attrition, indicating compensation as a significant retention factor.  
- Education level and field positively influence employee retention, particularly among employees with technical and life sciences backgrounds.  

## Business Impact
The insights derived from this analysis can help organizations:
- Identify high-risk employee segments  
- Improve retention strategies for early-career employees  
- Optimize compensation and career development plans  
- Support data-driven HR policies  

## Outcome
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Perform end-to-end HR data analysis  
- Build insight-driven Power BI dashboards  
- Translate HR metrics into clear, actionable business insights
